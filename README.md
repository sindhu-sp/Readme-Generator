# Readme-Generator

## About this challenge

In this challenge it is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 



## User Story

As a developer, the user wants a README generator, so that they can quickly create a professional README for a new project.



## Criteria

-  A command-line application that accepts user input.


- When prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

- When entering the project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README

- When entering a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

- When choosing a license for the application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

- When entering the GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile.

- When entering the email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach  with additional questions.

- When clicking on the links in the Table of Contents, then will be taken to the corresponding section of the README



## The Program Guidelines

- The following is the guidelines to get started:

- First, need to create a 
   - .gitignore file 
    - node_modules/ 
    - .DS_Store/ 

    so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. 

- Then create the
    - .gitignore 

    file before installing any npm dependencies.

- The repo includes a 

    - package.json 

    with the required dependencies. 

- This could be created by running the following command when first setting up the
    project, before installing any dependencies.

    - npm init 


- The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
